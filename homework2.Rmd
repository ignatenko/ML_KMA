# General information

In this homework you have to demonstrate ability to use R for exploring big and new dataset. Using *shiny* package you will build html page with connection to R server.  
The analysis shoud include following parts:

- Dataset description
- One variable analysis
- Two variable analysis  
- General explorations for categorical variables
- Linear regression

## How to choose dataset?

You can choose one dataset from following sources (be sure to choose unique - send me message about your decision)

- https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/
- https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-large-datasets-open-to-the-public
- http://data.gov.ua/datasets

There are some resctrictions on your choice:

- dataset should be "large enough" - close to 10000 observations
- dataset should include 3-5 categorical and 3-5 non-categorical variables
- you cannot use standard R datasets

## Deadline

Deadline for maximum excellent grade is 15/12/2016. Later - 1 grade down per week.

# Dataset description

Here you should provide interface to show answers for questions about dataset in general. We will consider diamond dataset as working example. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Dataset __diamonds__ 

The dataset contains information on prices of diamonds, as well as various attributes of diamonds, some of which are known to influence their price (in 2008 $s): the 4 Cs (carat, cut, color, and clarity) , as well as some physical measurements (depth, table, price, x, y, and z). The figure below shows what these measurements represent.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diamond1.png",dpi = 100)
```

Carat is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls. Cut grade is is an objective measure of a diamond’s light performance, or, what we generally think of as sparkle.

The figures below shows color grading of diamonds:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diamond3.png",dpi = 100)
```

Lastly, the figure below shows clarity grading of diamonds:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diamond4.png",dpi = 100)
```

### Dimensions

```{r}
dim(diamonds)
nrow(diamonds)
ncol(diamonds)
```

### Structure

```{r}
str(diamonds)
```

For categorical values we can calculate levels

```{r}
levels(diamonds$clarity)
```

Finally we can show full summary on all variables

```{r}
summary(diamonds)
```

and show summary on each particular variable 

```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)
```

**Task 1**
   Build shiny application to show
   
1. General information about dataset
   
2. Panel where we can choose one or all variables and show statistical summary
    
3. Slider to choose sample from dataset to calculate statistics 

# One variable analysis

To understand probability distribution histogram is the main tool

```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=500, aes(x=diamonds$price)) + 
  ggtitle("Diamond Price Distribution") + 
  xlab("Diamond Price U$") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + theme_minimal()
```

changing binwidth and margins we can found interesting results

```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds) + geom_histogram(binwidth=50, aes(x=diamonds$price)) + ggtitle("Diamond Price Distribution") + xlab("Diamond Price U$ - Binwidth 50") + ylab("Frequency") + theme_minimal() + xlim(0,2500)
```

## Different looks on data

### Geom_point with jitter

To see amount of diamonds for each cut~color pair we can use jitter idea

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=color, y=cut, color = price)) + 
    geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.5, height = 0.5))
```

### Violin representation

To see amount of diamonds for each price~color pair we can use 

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=color, y=price)) + geom_violin()
```

### Frequency polygons

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth)) +
geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE) +
xlim(58, 68) +
theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## A look into boxplots

The next assignment is about investigating the price of diamonds using box plots, numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical variables: cut, clarity, or color.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(factor(cut), price, fill=cut)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Diamond Price according Cut") + xlab("Type of Cut") + ylab("Diamond Price U$") + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,7500))
```

It’s hard to draw conclusions; it seems that cut of all types carry prices of all types, not really a way to determine how good or expensive a diamond is. I suspect people never take a magnifying glass and really look at the cut when they choose a diamond unless they are true proffesionals. Let’s see the same chart using clarity

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(factor(clarity), price, fill=clarity)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Diamond Price according Clarity") + xlab("Clarity") + ylab("Diamond Price U$") + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,7500))
```
OK! This is more meaningful, we even get a few outliers (I limited the number of outliers by using xlim=c(0,7500)) or no more than U$7,500 dollars. So clarity is a meaningful variable where cut is not. We can conclude people see and appreciate more shiny things?

The next part is formulating questions about color and price range inside a IQR (interquartile range - between 25%-50%) range. These are the following.

- What is the price range for the middle 50% of diamonds with color D (best color)?
- What is the price range for the middle 50% of diamonds with color J (worst color)?
- What is the IQR for diamonds with the best color (color D)?
- What is the IQR for diamonds with the worst color (color J)?

using IQR functions (you can read help topic about it)
```{r}
IQR(subset(diamonds, diamonds$color == 'D')$price)
IQR(subset(diamonds, diamonds$color == 'J')$price)
```

This is very strange (the results are fine), people actually pay more on average for a J color diamonds (worst color) than for a D color diamond (best color)!

How about we investigate the price per carat of diamonds across the different colors of diamonds using boxplots? This sounds like a big effort but it’s actually just a little change of code.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(factor(color), (price/carat), fill=color)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Diamond Price per Carat according Color") + xlab("Color") + ylab("Diamond Price per Carat U$")
```

Now that is a big quantity of outliers for color D. I can see where people spend their money, not on the under U$7,500 range, but rather on the most unique rocks. We can limit the price range to under U$7,500 and see a smaller picture.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(factor(color), (price/carat), fill=color)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Diamond Price per Carat according Color") + xlab("Color") + ylab("Diamond Price per Carat U$") + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,7500))

```

How strange, under the U$7,500 range the price per carat of diamonds is actually more expensive on color G (medium quality on the scale) than any other color.

The more I study these charts, the more I see that people know very little about diamonds, and pay way more for medium-quality rocks because cut, color and clarity are still very hard to define and detect for the untrained eye.

**Task 2**
   Build shiny application to show one variable graphs (at least 5 types)

1. Histogram for different variables

2. Boxplot for different variables

3. Formulate non-obvious suggestion for data and try to prove it by graphical picture.

# Two variable analysis

It is important to have filtered and prepeared data before analysis. The goal of **dplyr package** is to provide verbs (functions) that help you solve the most common 95% of data manipulation problems. dplyr is similar to ggplot2, but instead of providing a grammar of graphics, it provides a grammar of data manipulation. Like ggplot2, dplyr helps you not just by giving you functions,
but it also helps you think about data manipulation. In particular, dplyr
helps by constraining you: instead of struggling to think about which of the
thousands of functions that might help, you can just pick from a handful that
are design to be very likely to be helpful. In this chapter you’ll learn four of
the most important dplyr verbs:

- filter()
- mutate()
- group_by() & summarise()

These verbs are easy to learn because they all work the same way: they
take a data frame as the first argument, and return a modified data frame.
The other arguments control the details of the transformation, and are al-
ways interpreted in the context of the data frame so you can refer to variables
directly.

Consider diamonds x, y values

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x, y)) +
geom_bin2d()
```

There are around 50,000 points in this dataset: most of them lie along the
diagonal, but there are a handful of outliers. One clear set of incorrect values
are those diamonds with zero dimensions. We can use filter() to pull them
out:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
filter(diamonds, x == 0 | y == 0)
```

Now we create filtered set of diamonds 

```{r}
diamonds_ok <- filter(diamonds, x > 0, y > 0, y < 20)
ggplot(diamonds_ok, aes(x, y)) +
geom_bin2d() +
geom_abline(slope = 1, colour = "white", size = 1, alpha = 0.5)
```

To create new variables use mutate() . Like filter() it takes a data frame
as its first argument and returns a data frame. Its second and subsequent
arguments are named expressions that generate new variables. Like filter()
you can refer to variables just by their name, you don’t need to also include
the name of the dataset.

```{r}
diamonds_ok2 <- mutate(diamonds_ok,
sym = x - y,
size = sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
)
head(diamonds_ok2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds_ok2, aes(size, sym)) +
stat_bin2d()
```

Many insightful visualisations require that you reduce the full dataset down to a meaningful summary. ggplot2 provides a number of geoms that will do summaries for you. But it’s often useful to do summaries by hand: that gives you more flexibility and you can use the summaries for other purposes.

dplyr does summaries in two steps:

1. Define the grouping variables with group_by() .

2. Describe how to summarise each group with a single row with summarise()

For example, to look at the average price per clarity, we first group by
clarity, then summarise:
```{r}
by_clarity <- group_by(diamonds, clarity)
sum_clarity <- summarise(by_clarity, price = mean(price))
sum_clarity
```

Now we try to reveal some dependancies between price and different parameters:

```{r}
ggplot(sum_clarity, aes(clarity, price)) +
geom_line(aes(group = 1), colour = "grey80") +
geom_point(size = 2)
```

Interesting pattern: why do diamonds with better clarity have lower prices?

Supply additional variables to group_by() to create groups based on more
than one variable. The next example shows how we can compute (by hand)
a frequency polygon that shows how cut and depth interact. The special
summary function n() counts the number of observations in each group.

```{r}
cut_depth <- summarise(group_by(diamonds, cut, depth), n = n())
cut_depth <- filter(cut_depth, depth > 55, depth < 70)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cut_depth, aes(depth, n, colour = cut)) +
geom_line()
```

We can use a grouped mutate() to convert counts to proportions, so it’s
easier to compare across the cuts. summarise() strips one level of grouping
off, so cut_depth will be grouped by cut.

```{r}
cut_depth <- mutate(cut_depth, prop = n / sum(n))
ggplot(cut_depth, aes(depth, prop, colour = cut)) +
geom_line()
```

summarise() needs to be used with functions that take a vector of n values
and always return a single value. Those functions include:

- Counts: n() , n_distinct(x)

- Middle: mean(x) , median(x)

- Spread: sd(x) , mad(x) , IQR(x)

- Extremes: quartile(x) , min(x) , max(x)

- Positions: first(x) , last(x) , nth(x, 2)

When summarising with the mean or median, it’s always a good idea to
include a count and a measure of spread. This helps you calibrate your assessments - if you don’t include them you’re likely to think that the data is
less variable than it really is, and potentially draw unwarranted conclusions.

The following example extends our previous summary of the average price
by clarity to also include the number of observations in each group, and the
upper and lower quartiles. It suggests the mean might be a bad summary for
this data - the distributions of price are so highly skewed that the mean is
higher than the upper quartile for some of the groups!

```{r}
by_clarity <- diamonds %>%
group_by(clarity) %>%
summarise(
n = n(),
mean = mean(price),
lq = quantile(price, 0.25),
uq = quantile(price, 0.75)
)
```

```{r}
ggplot(by_clarity, aes(clarity, mean)) +
geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lq, ymax = uq)) +
geom_line(aes(group = 1), colour = "grey50") +
geom_point(aes(size = n))

```

**Task 3**
   
   Build shiny application to show two-variable dependancies (at least 3 type of graphs)

1. Use dplyr package to summarise variables

2. Show two variable graphs for different pairs

3. Make some conclusion on found graphical pictures.

# General explorations for many variables

## Here we will try to reveal some hidden properties of the data

This is plot of log10(price)~carat

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  xlim(c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))) + 
  ylab('Price (log10)') + 
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Carat')
```


## Cut and Diamonds Price

Cut means quality of the cut, which includes Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal. Ideal is the best quality. We will modify the previous plot by adding the cut.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Cut', reverse = T)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  xlim(c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))) + 
  ylab('Price (log10)') + 
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Carat and Cut')
```

It does not seem like cut is a very clear indicator of diamonds price. For example, given the same carat, we can see the Ideal cut can fall into anywhere. The price of a 1.25 ideal cut carat diamond ranges from $5,000 to $15,000.

## Color and Diamonds Price

Let us look into the relationship between color and diamonds price then. Diamond color ranges from J (worst) to D (best).

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = color)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Color', reverse = T)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  xlim(c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))) + 
  ylab('Price (log10)') + 
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Carat and Color')

```

## Clarity and Diamonds Price

Finally, let us look into the relationship between clarity and diamonds price. Clarity is a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF (best)).

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = clarity)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  xlim(c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))) + 
  ylab('Price (log10)') + 
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Carat and Clarity')
```

Also we can use facets to include more dimensions on view

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price,color = clarity)) +
  facet_wrap(~cut) + 
    geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  xlim(c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))) + 
  ylab('Price (log10)') + 
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Carat and Clarity. Facets - cut')
```


**Task 4**

1. Choose variables which are promising for hidden relations (at least 2 pairs)

2. Create Shiny app for constructing different views for each pair

3. Use facets to include more variables

4. Make your own conclusions about relation between variables in your dataset

# Linear regression

So far our analysis of the diamonds data has been plagued by the powerful
relationship between size and price. It makes it very difficult to see the impact
of cut, colour and clarity because higher quality diamonds tend to be smaller,
and hence cheaper. This challenge is often called confounding. We can use a
linear model to remove the effect of size on price. Instead of looking at the
raw price, we can look at the relative price: how valuable is this diamond
relative to the average diamond of the same size.
To get started, we’ll focus on diamonds of size two carats or less (96%
of the dataset). This avoids some incidental problems that you can explore
in the exercises if you’re interested. We’ll also create two new variables: log
price and log carat. These variables are useful because they produce a plot
with a strong linear trend.

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>%
filter(carat <= 2) %>%
mutate(
lcarat = log2(carat),
lprice = log2(price)
)
diamonds2
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds2, aes(lcarat, lprice)) +
geom_bin2d() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 2, colour = "yellow")
```

In the graphic we used geom_smooth() to overlay the line of best fit to the
data. We can replicate this outside of ggplot2 by fitting a linear model with
lm(). This allows us to find out the slope and intercept of the line:

```{r}
mod <- lm(lprice ~ lcarat, data = diamonds2)
```

There some useful functions to describe linear model

```{r}
summary(mod) # full info
coefficients(mod) # model coefficients
confint(mod, level=0.95) # CIs for model parameters
head(residuals(mod)) # residuals
anova(mod) # anova table
vcov(mod) # covariance matrix for model parameters
```

Geometrically, the residuals
are the vertical distance between each point and the line of best fit. They tell
us the price relative to the “average” diamond of that size.

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds2 %>% mutate(rel_price = residuals(mod))
ggplot(diamonds2, aes(carat, rel_price)) +
geom_bin2d()
```

A relative price of zero means that the diamond was at the average price;
positive means that it’s more expensive than expected (based on its size),
and negative means that it’s cheaper than expected.
Interpreting the values precisely is a little tricky here because we’ve log-
transformed price. The residuals give the absolute difference (x - expected),
but here we have log~2~(price) - log~2~(expectedprice), or equivalently
log~2~(price/expectedprice).

Let’s use both price and relative price to see how colour and cut affect
the value of a diamond. We’ll compute the average price and average relative
price for each combination of colour and cut:

```{r}
color_cut <- diamonds2 %>%
group_by(color, cut) %>%
summarise(
price = mean(price),
rel_price = mean(rel_price)
)
```

If we look at price, it’s hard to see how the quality of the diamond affects
the price. The lowest quality diamonds (fair cut with colour J) have the
highest average value! This is because those diamonds also tend to be larger:
size and quality are confounded.

```{r}
ggplot(color_cut, aes(color, price)) +
geom_line(aes(group = cut), colour = "grey80") +
geom_point(aes(colour = cut))

```

If however, we plot the relative price, you see the pattern that you expect:
as the quality of the diamonds decreases, the relative price decreases.

```{r}
ggplot(color_cut, aes(color, rel_price)) +
geom_line(aes(group = cut), colour = "grey80") +
geom_point(aes(colour = cut))

```
